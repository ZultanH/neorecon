# Neoshaman's recon script
This tool/script is an accumulation of bash functions and tools 
I personally have been using to start my bug hunting journey

- rename recon.sh to .recon
- put in home directory
- must add a source to .bashrc/.zsh
- source ~/.recon
- Then HTP and have a fun day :)

## UNDER DEVELOPMENT
